	"information": "This image is of an oil pump in North Dakota, one of two states leading the growth in U.S. oil production as of November 2015. The top oil-producing states in the U.S. are Alaska, Louisiana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Texas. When oil prices are higher, these economies of these states improve. For example, there are more jobs, and those employees spend money on local business, making those businesses better off. In addition, the higher tax revenues paid to the states help the states balance their budgets and provide for the needs of their residents. In 2014, the U.S. became the biggest producer of petroleum in the world, primarily due to dramatic growth in production in North Dakota and Texas. Afterwards, Saudi Arabia and other countries vastly increased oil production around the world to force the price of oil lower, and try to drive new oil producers out of the market.",
